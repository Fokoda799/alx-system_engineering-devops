## SFTP (Introduction)

FTP, once a popular but now deprecated File Transfer Protocol ðŸšŒ, has been succeeded by **SFTP** (Secure File Transfer Protocol). Integrated into SSH, it provides a secure alternative for file transfers.

### How to Connect with SFTP

By default, SFTP leverages SSH for authentication and secure connections. For enhanced security, consider setting up SSH keys following [this guide][1].

Check SSH access with:
```bash
ssh sammy@your_server_ip_or_remote_hostname
```

Exit using:
```bash
exit
```

Initiate an SFTP session with:
```bash
sftp sammy@your_server_ip_or_remote_hostname
```

For custom SSH ports:
```bash
sftp -oPort=custom_port sammy@your_server_ip_or_remote_hostname
```

### Transferring Files with SFTP

#### Downloading from Remote Host
```bash
sftp> get remoteFile
```

#### Uploading to Remote System
```bash
sftp> put localFile
```
