**Web Stack Outage Postmortem**

**Issue Summary:**
- **Duration:** May 8, 2024, 10:00 AM - May 9, 2024, 2:00 AM (UTC)
- **Impact:** The outage affected our main web application, resulting in complete unavailability for 12 hours. Users experienced error messages and inability to access any features. Approximately 75% of users were affected.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the outage was traced back to a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, causing an overload on one of the backend servers.

**Timeline:**
- **10:00 AM (UTC):** The issue was detected when monitoring alerts indicated a spike in server response time.
- **10:15 AM:** Engineers began investigating the issue, initially assuming it was due to increased traffic.
- **11:00 AM:** Misleadingly, attention was focused on database performance, leading to unnecessary optimizations.
- **1:00 PM:** With no improvement, the incident was escalated to the backend infrastructure team.
- **3:00 PM:** Further investigation revealed the misconfigured load balancer as the likely culprit.

**Resolution:**
- **Root Cause:** The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings caused an imbalance in traffic distribution, overloading one backend server while leaving others underutilized.
- **Fix:** Load balancer settings were adjusted to evenly distribute traffic among backend servers, resolving the overload issue.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Implement automated checks for load balancer configurations to prevent similar misconfigurations in the future.
  - Enhance monitoring systems to provide more granular insights into server performance and traffic distribution.
  - Develop a comprehensive incident response plan outlining escalation procedures and responsibilities.
- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  - Patch the load balancer configuration to ensure proper traffic distribution.
  - Conduct a thorough review of all load balancer settings to identify and rectify any other potential misconfigurations.
  - Enhance monitoring capabilities to include real-time alerts for abnormal traffic patterns and server performance metrics.

**Conclusion:**
The outage on May 8, 2024, was a result of a misconfigured load balancer, which led to an overload on one backend server, causing a significant impact on our main web application. Through diligent investigation and corrective action, the issue was successfully resolved, and measures have been put in place to prevent similar incidents in the future.
